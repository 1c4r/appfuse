AppFuse
=====
[AppFuse](http://appfuse.org) is a full-stack framework for building web applications on the JVM. Rather than re-inventing the wheel, it integrates some of the most popular frameworks today, including Spring, Hibernate, Maven, jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.

To create a new application with AppFuse, see the [QuickStart Guide](http://appfuse.org/display/APF/AppFuse+QuickStart).
